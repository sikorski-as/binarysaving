# Binary saving
**Simple template functions that allows you to easily write to and read from binary files. 
A good solution for build-in C++ types.**

Do you have a class or a structure and you want to dump some of its members into a binary file? It was never simpler. These two functions lets you do it in a convenient way. Keep in mind, that it can lead to problems with more sophisticated types and classes, so basically it's the best solution for the most popular C++ types like ints or strings.
